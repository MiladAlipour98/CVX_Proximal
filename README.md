# CVX_Proximal
Proximal Gradient for Sparse Logistic Regression
In this project, we apply proximal gradient methods to build a classifier for recognizing handwritten digits from images. The goal is to learn the weights that minimize the negative log-likelihood over the training examples, with the addition of â„“1-regularization. We use the MNIST dataset, consisting of 1,000 training examples
