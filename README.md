# CVX_Proximal
Proximal Gradient for Sparse Logistic Regression
We employ proximal gradient methods to build a classifier for recognizing handwritten digits from images. The objective is to minimize the negative log-likelihood over the training examples with ℓ1-regularization. We derive the gradient of the smooth component of the objective, implement the proximal gradient method with and without acceleration, and evaluate the error rate as a function of the regularization parameter λ. We also explore making predictions on the test set and analyzing the classification results.
